MicrosporidiaDB belongs to the <a href="http://www.eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a> family of databases and is an integrated genomic and functional genomic 
database for the phylum <i>Microsporidia</i>.  In its first iteration (released in early 2010), MicrosporidiaDB contains the genomes of two  <i>Encephalitozoon</i> species 
(see below).  
MicrosporidiaDB integrates whole genome sequence and annotation and will rapidly expand to include experimental data and environmental isolate sequences 
provided by community researchers . The database includes supplemental bioinformatics analyses and a web interface for data-mining.

EuPathDB databases rely heavily on community input.  Each project in EuPathDB benefits from the advice and mentoring of members from each specific community. 
We hold monthly organism calls for each of our databases with members of the scientific advisory teams and others from the community.  
Anyone interested in joining one of these conference calls is encouraged to contact us.  While monthly conference calls for MicrosporidiaDB are already underway, 
a specific scientific advisory team as not yet been assembled.

MicrosporidiaDB is a member of pathogen-databases that are housed under 
the NIAID-funded <a href="http://www.eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a> 
Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC) umbrella. The EuPathDB team is 
mainly distributed between the University of Pennsylvania in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the University of Georgia in Athens,
