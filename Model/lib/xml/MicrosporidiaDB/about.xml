There are several kinds of downloads available in a EuPathDB site:
<div id="cirbulletlist">
<ul>
<li> Download files that have we create at release time. The link to access these files is under the menu item "Downloads", under "Data Files". These include
 fasta files for all available sequences, gff files with complete gene information, and other formats.
<li> Download files that are generated by running queries. From a result page (after running a query) a user can access the "Download Resuts" link, to a new 
page where a few different options are offered. The goal is to construct a file for download that include all IDs in the result; the user requests a file for
mat and, in some formats, the user may request additional information about the result IDs.
<li> Download files that have been uploaded by the community in our websites, available under "Downloads" or "Community".
</ul>
