We use the <b>G</b>enomics <b>U</b>nified <b>S</b>chema (GUS) database schema and data loading infrastructure available at <a href="http://www.gusdb.org">GusDB.org</a>.  This includes not only a comprehensive database schema for integrating and representing genomic and functional (or post) genomic data but also tools for loading said data into that system.  We have made some extenstions to the schema and tools for EuPathDB specific purposes primarily to generate de-normalized views of the data for query optimization purposes.</p><br>
<p>
Our data are all stored in Oracle11g databases.  Our software infrastructure also supports PostgreSQL but we have some Oracle specific SQL constructs in our model that would need to be changed in order to run successfully in PostgreSQL.  </p><br>
<p>
We load all data using an in house engineered workflow sytem called ReFlow.  Documentation and code for ReFlow can be found on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/reflow-genomics/">ReFlow google code repository</a>.  Briefly, ReFlow is engineered to be an efficient graph based workflow system any step of which has the ability to be undone and subsequently rerun with updated data.  This was a significant requirement as it enables us to undo entire genomes when the annotation or underlying sequence changes.  This results in automated removal of all data dependent on that genome and when it is re-run with the new annotation, all dependent data are recomputed and reloaded automatically, thus greatly improving our ability to keep these complex databases up-to-date.  
A significant component of our dataloading system is our ability to automate the running of large compute tasks on compute clusters located at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Georgia.  The ReFlow workflow sytem utilizes another piece of software developed at the University of Pennsylvania to schedule, manage and monitor running tasks called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fpub%3Fid%3D1BixZ5t2c0hnOZES-Rk2wG2loAQqclcmRj7AeKQjZMHA">DistribJob</a>.  DistribJob distributes tasks generated from a large input dataset such as a set of sequences to compute nodes in a cluster for analysis and retrieves and collates the results in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>Our websites are based on code that we developed and have released to the community called the Strategies-WDK (Strategies Web Development Kit) which enables the graphical strategies search system.  You can download the software and see documentation for this toolkit at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/strategies-wdk/">Strategies-WDK google code website</a>.  This toolkit enables us to represent our data as an XML model which is then turned into the web interfaces that are presented to users using these tools.</p>

<p>EuPathDB maintains redundant production database and web servers at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Georgia to assure minimal interruptions for our users.  Additionally EuPathDB compute and data loading servers are located at the University of Pennsylvania.  These servers are managed by Puppet in order to keep them up-to-date and in sync with needs.  Both Universities also maintain large compute clusters that are heavily utilized by EuPathDB in order to analyze and load incoming data in a timely fashion.  The linked document below describes our actual hardware and includes a list of third-party software required in order to analyze, load and present data via our websites.</p>
