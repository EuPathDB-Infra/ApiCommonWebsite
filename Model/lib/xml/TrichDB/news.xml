<span style="font-weight: bold;">New Features in TrichDB</span><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>You can now search for DNA segments defined by their chromosomal
location or their nucleotide sequence (DNA motif pattern).&nbsp; This
new search is available under "Identify Other Data Types"; click on
"Genomic Segments (DNA motif)" then select either <a
style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=SpanQuestions.DynSpansByMotifSearch">DNA
motif pattern</a> or <a style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=SpanQuestions.DynSpansBySourceId">Genomic
Location</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
</div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>We introduced a new combine operation that allows users to
combine
steps based on relative locations on the genome.&nbsp; This enables
you, for
example, to return all genes that contain a specific DNA motif within
1000 nucleotides upstream of the annotated start site. Or you could
return all genes that have a SNP between two strains within 500
nucleotides of the start of the gene (or return all SNPs that are
located in this region relative to genes).&nbsp; <br>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li>Here is an <a style="font-weight: bold;"
href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=e892ef6112576c45">example
search strategy</a> that identifies protein coding genes with an AP-2
like motif within 1000 bp of their 5' end.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li>Tutorials highlighting the <a style="font-weight: bold;"

</ul>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In addition, several new tutorials have been developed:<br>

<b>We are pleased to report that the following Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) have been awarded in connection with the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC):</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>The Toxoplasma oocyst transcriptome and proteome</b><br>
   John Boothroyd, Matt Bogyo (Stanford) & Pat Conrad (UC Davis)<br>
   This project is expected to yield expression data from an important, but inaccessible, life cycle stage (1 yr). <br><br></li>
<li><b>A comprehensive catalog of the T. gondii & N. caninum parasite & infected host cell transcriptome & proteome</b><br>
   Brian Gregory (Univ. Pennsylvania) & Jonathan Wastling (Univ. Liverpool)<br>
   This project will produce an immense volume of sequence data, driving database improvements for handling 'next-gen' sequencing, non-coding RNAs, and interrogating host & pathogen datasets in parallel (2 yr).<br><br></li>

<li><b>Dissection of Plasmodium falciparum genetic crosses by mass spectrometry-based metabolite QTL</b><br>
   Manuel Llin&aacute;s (Princeton) & Michael Ferdig (Notre Dame)<br>
   This project is expected to improve handling of genetic mapping data, incorporation of metabolomics results (integrated with pathway maps), and linking of specific genetic loci with metabolite abundance (2 yr).<br><br></li>
</ul>

A biennial competition for DBP awards is mandated by the BRC contract from NIH/NIAID, and supported by a total of $1.2M in total costs per award cycle.  The goal of this program is to produce high value genomic-scale datasets for the EuPathDB user community, and drive the further development of bioinformatics resources for data analysis and mining.<br><br>

Letters of intent (LOI) were solicited in February (see Feb 4 News item), and reviewed by the EuPathDB Scientific Working Group (SWG; see News, March 31).  12 full applications were solicited from among the ~50 LOIs received, and awards were based on further scientific review by the SWG, and in consultation with NIAID program staff.  Cost negotiations and 'in kind' contributions from other sources made it possible to support 3 applications, from 6 investigators (in some cases, more than one LOI was merged into a single award).<br><br>

We received far more high quality proposals than could be supported, testifying to the need for such mechanisms for data production bioinformatics analysis.  The EuPathDB team looks forward to working with members of our user community who are seeking funding for such projects from external sources.  Inquiries, including requests for support letters, should be directed to the EuPathDB staff (click on the 'Contact Us' link).<br><br>

<b>A new solicitation for DBPs is anticipated in 2011, and will be announced on the EuPathDB web site.</b>

<body>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce the release of TrichDB 1.2<br>
<br>
<br>
This release of TrichDB contains the following new datasets and
features:</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;<br>
<br>
New Data:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">T. vaginalis</span>
proteomic data&nbsp;graciously provided
pre-publication by the Patricia Johnson laboratory. &nbsp;Searching
this data can be performed via the <a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByMassSpec">Mass
spec. evidence search page</a> in TrichDB.</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Features introduced this year:<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Basket"</span> allows one to cherry pick genes and add them to
the basket for subsequent conversion into a step in a strategy.
&nbsp;The basket is accessible from the gray menu bar and the
number of items in your basket is indicated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weighted
searches</span>&nbsp;allows you to assign an arbitrary weight
to the searches (steps) in
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list
of your results. &nbsp;</li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of
the
same strategy looking for putative secretory enzymes. &nbsp;Notice
that you
have a larger number of results with weighting and those can be sorted
based on the sum of the weights, giving a ranked list of results.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=943679804a1cf881">Putative
secretory enzyme (unweighted)</a><br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=abc006f322db8e95">Putative
  </a><a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=abc006f322db8e95">secretory
enzyme</a><a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/im.do?s=abc006f322db8e95">
(Weighted)</a></div>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Favorites"</span> (new in this release) allows you to bookmark
and organize genes you
access frequently. &nbsp;A tutorial on how to use this feature is
available <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org/tutorials/Favorites/favorites_viewlet_swf.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Feature evaluators still needed:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome you to *sign
up* to be an early evaluator of new features on the EuPathDB sites.
This will be an opportunity for you to help us refine and improve
features early in the development process.&nbsp;In fact, the "My
Favorites" feature was the subject of our first survey and feature
evaluator's comments and suggestions contributed to enhancing this
feature. <br>
<br>
Signing on is easy and will
require minimal effort on your part in the form of answering questions
or rendering your opinion. &nbsp;<br>

(Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), the Eukaryotic Pathogen Bioinformatics Resource Center 
(University of Georgia and University of Pennsylvania, US), and the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute (US). 
This residential workshop aims to provide experimental biologists with hands-on experience in 
genomic-scale data analysis, including genome browsers and comparison tools, methods for 
data integration, and resources for sophisticated data mining.
Many examples and exercises will be drawn from the kinetoplastida, including <i>Leishmania spp.</i>, 
<i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, although applicants working on other protozoan 
parasites will also benefit.<br><br>

We are pleased to announce the release of TrichDB  (<a href="http://www.trichdb.org/">http://www.trichdb.org</a> )  a new Web resource for interrogating the Trichomonas vaginalis genome, which was sequenced and annotated at The Institute for Genomics Research and published in Science magazine in early 2007.
<br><br>
TrichDB is modeled after the ApiDB family of apicomplexan genome database query sites (<a href="http://apidb.org">http://www.apiddb.org</a>).  Like those sites, TrichDB offers researchers a plethora of  tools for genomic data mining.  In addition to BLAST and pattern/motif similarity searches, users can identify T. vaginalis genes by genomic position; common name or keyword; gene attributes such as gene type and exon number; transcript expression evidence (ESTs including prepublication ESTs kindly provided by Dr. Petrus Tang and collaborators); physical characteristics of predicted proteins such as molecular weight and secondary structure;  predicted function from Gene Ontology and EC enzyme number annotation;  and cellular location.  Along with these tools for gene analysis there are also identification tools for ESTs and ORFs. A special feature of TrichDB is the ability to separately query repeat genes, which constitute a large fraction of the T. vaginalis genome.
<br><br>
TrichDB couples a comprehensive set of querying tools with extensively hyperlinked and highly-configurable displays of results. Numerous evidence types and data associated with a gene, including gene context, predicted protein, EST and BLAST alignments, and %GC content, can be displayed in a single graphic.  Users can choose just which elements to show in a display, allowing them to generate purpose-built images for presentation.
<br><br>
Finally, TrichDB is also a repository for T. vaginalis genome statistics, data and methods source links, links to other Trichmonas community web sites,  and daily updates of Trichomonas publications and genes deposited in Pubmed/Entrez.  New users can learn to use the TrichDB/ApiDB sites via a set of online tutorials linked from the TrichDB front page.
<br><br>
We hope you will take time to explore TrichDB. Please use the link found at the bottom of every TrichDB page to send us feedback  (<a href="http://giardiadb.org/giardiadb/help.jsp"  target="_blank">Contact Us!</a>).  We look forward to hearing from you!
<br><br>
Best regards,
<br>
