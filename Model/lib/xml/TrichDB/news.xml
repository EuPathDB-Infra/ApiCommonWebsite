         <![CDATA[<b>We are pleased to
announce the implementation of new features in TrichDB:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Identify Genes based on Orthology Phylogenetic
Profile:&nbsp; For example you may ask for genes in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">T. vaginalis&nbsp;</span>that
do not have orthologs in mammals.&nbsp; Click here to explore this
feature.</li>
  <li>A table of paralogs (if any) is now available on gene pages
allowing you to view expanded gene families -- See <a
 href="http://trichdb.org/trichdb/showRecord.do?name=GeneRecordClasses.GeneRecordClass&amp;source_id=TVAG_386080&amp;project_id=TrichDB">TVAG_386080</a>
for example (scroll down to the Orthologs and Paralogs Table).</li>
  <li>Now after you perform a BlastN against genomic sequence you
can link from the the blast output to the correct coordinates in the
genome browser.&nbsp; This allows you to explore annotation and
other functional data in relation to your BLAST hits.</li>
  <li>The type ahead feature has been implemented for GO term, EC
number and Interpro domain searches.</li>
  <li>You can now edit or delete your user comments.</li>
  <li>You can now modify your user profile, change your password
or your email address.</li>
</ul>
<br>
We are still collecting data sets for an upcoming release of
TrichDB.&nbsp; This release will include a large expansion in data
content and we look forward to receiving more data sets from you.<br>
<br>
Also, check out the new version of <a href="http://eupathdb.org">EuPathDB</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
EuPathDB permits searches across all organism-specific sites and now
includes the strategy system.&nbsp;Build multi-step searches using
a graphical interface that is feature-rich. You can save your
strategies, modify any step in a strategy or even share your strategy
with other scientists.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
The EuPathDB team.

We are pleased to announce the release of TrichDB 1.1
<p>
This release features a new user interface with added functionality and a graphical strategy system for building complex searches.
<p>
The new user interface contains many new features including:
<ul>
<li>  A new search strategy interface that enables users to more easily construct complex searches.
<li>  'User Comments' have been updated to enable submission of supporting evidence including pubmed identifiers and images (or other files). Comments may be added to any gene or sequence page, enhancing available annotation. 
<li>  Files can now be uploaded and provided to the community via the file repository section.
</ul>
<p>
The previous version of TrichDB may still be accessed <a href='http://old.trichdb.org'>here</a>.

We are pleased to report
an award from the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a> in support of a
TrypDB component of the <a href="http://eupathdb.org/">EuPathDB</a> family of databases,
encompassing <i>Leishmania</i> species, <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and
<i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>.  A coordinated award from the<a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/"> Wellcome Trust</a>
will permit enhanced annotation of kinetoplastid parasites. 
These projects represent a collaborative effort between the
GeneDB team (at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute), colleagues
at the <a href="http://www.sbri.org/">Seattle Biomedical Research Institute</a>, and the EuPathDB
team -- an NIAID-supported Bioinformatics Resource Center. Look
for the first release of TrypDB in Jan 2009!

We are pleased to announce the release of TrichDB  (<a href="/">http://www.trichdb.org</a> )  a new Web resource for interrogating the Trichomonas vaginalis genome, which was sequenced and annotated at The Institute for Genomics Research and published in Science magazine in early 2007.
<br><br>
TrichDB is modeled after the ApiDB family of apicomplexan genome database query sites (<a href="http://apidb.org">http://www.apiddb.org</a>).  Like those sites, TrichDB offers researchers a plethora of  tools for genomic data mining.  In addition to BLAST and pattern/motif similarity searches, users can identify T. vaginalis genes by genomic position; common name or keyword; gene attributes such as gene type and exon number; transcript expression evidence (ESTs including prepublication ESTs kindly provided by Dr. Petrus Tang and collaborators); physical characteristics of predicted proteins such as molecular weight and secondary structure;  predicted function from Gene Ontology and EC enzyme number annotation;  and cellular location.  Along with these tools for gene analysis there are also identification tools for ESTs and ORFs. A special feature of TrichDB is the ability to separately query repeat genes, which constitute a large fraction of the T. vaginalis genome.
<br><br>
TrichDB couples a comprehensive set of querying tools with extensively hyperlinked and highly-configurable displays of results. Numerous evidence types and data associated with a gene, including gene context, predicted protein, EST and BLAST alignments, and %GC content, can be displayed in a single graphic.  Users can choose just which elements to show in a display, allowing them to generate purpose-built images for presentation.
<br><br>
Finally, TrichDB is also a repository for T. vaginalis genome statistics, data and methods source links, links to other Trichmonas community web sites,  and daily updates of Trichomonas publications and genes deposited in Pubmed/Entrez.  New users can learn to use the TrichDB/ApiDB sites via a set of online tutorials linked from the TrichDB front page.
<br><br>
We hope you will take time to explore TrichDB. Please use the link found at the bottom of every TrichDB page to send us feedback  (<a href="/giardiadb/help.jsp"  target="_blank" onClick="poptastic(this.href); return false;">Contact Us!</a>).  We look forward to hearing from you!
<br><br>
Best regards,
<br>
The TrichDB Team
