<body>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce the release of ToxoDB 6.2<br>
</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New Data in this release:</span><span
style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
<br>
</span>This release of ToxoDB includes the tachyzoite cell-cycle
microarray
data from Michael White (<a
href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0012354"><span
style="font-style: italic;">Behnke et. al.</span></a>).&nbsp; Searches
against this data are available in the <a
href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalQuestions.GenesByMicroarrayEvidence">microarray
search page</a> of ToxoDB under the heading "Tachyzoite Cell Cycle
(White)".&nbsp; This data can be interrogated using a number of
searches:<br>
<ul>
<li>Genes can be identified based on the fold change in their
expression between selected time points from the experiment using the
T.g.
Cell Cycle (fold change).</li>
<li>Genes can be identified based on their maximal or minimal
expression among selected time points using the T.g. Cell Cycle (exprn
timing) search.</li>
<li>Genes with a similar expression profile throughout the cell cycle
compared to an input gene can be identified using the T.g. Cell Cycle
(similarity) search.&nbsp; For example, genes that have a similar
expression profile throughout the cell cycle compared to a putative
nucleoporin can be identified as illustrated by this <a
href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/im.do?s=590909d092fa1fdf">search strategy</a>.&nbsp;
A graphical representation of the search results is presented along
with the list of results showing the expression profile of the
reference gene and each of the comparator genes.</li>
</ul>
In addition to specific searches against the cell cycle data, each gene
page contains a graphical representation of the gene's expression
profile throughout the cell cycle.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New features in this release:</span><br>
<ul>
<li>Improved organization of the <a
href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=InternalQuestions.GenesByMicroarrayEvidence=InternalQuestions.GenesByMicroarrayEvidence">microarray
search page</a>.</li>
<li>The search strategy window is now resizable.</li>

<body>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce new features in ToxoDB 6.0<br>
<br>
<br>
In an effort to continue improving the utility of ToxoDB</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> we have
implemented several new features in recent releases. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Basket"</span> allows one to cherry pick genes and add them to
the basket for subsequent conversion into a step in a strategy.
&nbsp;The basket is accessible from the gray menu bar and the
number of items in your basket is indicated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weighted
searches</span>&nbsp;allows you to assign an arbitrary weight
to the searches (steps) in
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list
of your results. &nbsp;</li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of
the
same strategy looking for secreted bradyzoite genes under diversifying
selection. &nbsp;Notice
that you
have a larger number of results with weighting and those can be sorted
based on the sum of the weights, giving a ranked list of results.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/im.do?s=d13693bed724f6bf">Putative
secreted brady (unweighted)</a><br>
  <a href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/im.do?s=a77c98e7c93296c1"><br>
  </a><a href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/im.do?s=a77c98e7c93296c1">Putative
secreted brady (Weighted)</a></div>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Favorites"</span> allows you to bookmark and organize genes you
access frequently. &nbsp;A tutorial on how to use this feature is
available <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org/tutorials/Favorites/favorites_viewlet_swf.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Feature evaluators still needed:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome you to *sign
up* to be an early evaluator of new features on the EuPathDB sites.
This will be an opportunity for you to help us refine and improve
features early in the development process.&nbsp;In fact, the "My
Favorites" feature was the subject of our first survey and feature
evaluator's comments and suggestions contributed to enhancing this
feature. <br>
<br>
Signing on is easy and will
require minimal effort on your part in the form of answering questions
or rendering your opinion. &nbsp;<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to 
announce new features in ToxoDB 6.0<br> 
<br> 
Community Annotation<span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span><br> 
<br> 
</span>As many of you know, a community driven annotation effort 
has been underway. &nbsp;The response has been great (350 genes 
have been annotated by the community so far) and we are happy to now 
include these annotations in ToxoDB. &nbsp;The ultimate goal is to 
translate this effort into changes in product names and gene models. 
&nbsp;As a first step, since this process is still ongoing, 
community annotations can be viewed by searching using the 
<a href="http://toxodb.org/toxo/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByTextSearch">
text search tool</a> in ToxoDB and limiting your search to 
the Community annotation. &nbsp;To view all genes that have a 
community annotation associated with them simply enter the wild card 
"*" in the text search field. &nbsp;The annotation itself is 
prominently displayed on the gene pages right under the product name. 
&nbsp;<br> 
<br> 
As noted, this is an ongoing process. &nbsp;We have several more 
annotations to incorporate and many more promised. &nbsp;<span 
style="font-weight: bold;"><br> 
<br> 
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">New Features:</span><br><br> 
<ul> 
 <li>The gray tool bar at the top of all ToxoDB web pages has 
been enhanced to include a link to the "My Basket" feature including an 
indication of how may items are in the basket.</li> 
 <li>The genome browser has been updated to version 1.7, which 
offers enhanced features and stability.&nbsp;</li> 
 <li>Weighted searches are now available. &nbsp;This feature 
allows you to assign an arbitrary weight to the searches (steps) in 
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list 
of your results.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul>

ToxoDB 4.2 provides microarray expression data and mass-spec data, and queries against them. The Genome Browser has new tracks for the proteomics data, and cosmid and BAC ends. 
<p>
The ToxoDB 4.2 web site also has significant improvements to the query and results pages. Many of the queries have been reorganized. For example, the SNPs based on Gene ID query now allows an input of a list of genes, either put in by hand or uploaded from a file. The results from this and all other queries can be sorted on various columns. It is also now possible to add columns of interest (e.g., protein features, GO annotation, even expression characteristics for gene results) and sort on them.
<p>
New data and queries in ToxoDB 4.2:
<ul>
<li>Two expression experiments carried out on the Toxo Affymetrix array, namely:
  <ul>
  <li> Effects of Glucose Starvation in Toxoplasma gondii 
  <li> Expression profiling of the 3 archetypal T. gondii lineages
  </ul>
 have been added to the ToxoDB Database, and queries are provided to find genes by differential expression and by percentile of expression.

<li> Proteomics data provided by two labs (Wastling and Murray) have been loaded, and these are visible on the Genome Sequence Browser. Queries to find genes, or ORFs, that show evidence of protein expression based on Mass Spec analyses are also available.
<li>BAC ends and cosmid ends sequences have been loaded, and can be viewed in the Genome Sequence Browser
<li>A mapping of epitopes to <i>Toxoplasma</i> provided by the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) <http://www.immuneepitope.org/home.do>. A query is now provided to identify genes whose encoding protein has an epitope at different levels of confidence.
<li>Updated E.C. number and metabolic pathway assignments, Interpro protein domains and associated GO predictions, 
<li>A new build of ortholog groups from Orthomcl for use in ToxoDB. The list of genomes represented has increased from 55 to 87  and includes all the organisms covered by the different NIH/NIAID funded Bioinformatics Resource Centers.
<li>ToxoCyc, a database of computationally predicted metabolic pathways for <i>Toxplasma</i>, is available online and is cross-referenced on the gene pages of ToxoDB.
</ul>
<p>
New features in ToxoDB 4.2:
<ul>
<li>Most of the queries have been reorganized to make them more intuitive. Some include a new "Advanced Parameters" section. See for example "Identify Genes based on EST evidence."
<li>The columns displayed in query result pages are improved.  The result pages also offer options for sorting, adding new columns, and moving columns around.
<li>Downloading results is improved. A choice of formats is provided including tab-delimited, text, GFF, and FASTA to meet different needs.
  <ul>
  <li>Tab delimited provides an expanded list of annotations that can be directly exported as an Excel spreadsheet.
  <li>Text provides a detailed summary for each gene including SNPs, metabolic pathways, notes, sequence, and many other choices.
  <li> GFF is a format recognized by many applications such as the genome browser, gbrowse.
  <li> FASTA also provides a common format used for BLAST and other applications. The FASTA option provides the functionality of the SRT (sequence retrieval tool).
  </ul>
<li> As per request, we have provided for Blast against GT1, VEG and RH (Chr Ia, Ib) genome sequences, in addition to the reference ME49 genome.

 We are pleased to announce Version 4.0 of the Toxoplasma Genome Database. 

<p>ToxoDB provides access to the genome sequence and annotation of the apicomplexan parasite <i>T. gondii</i> &nbsp; (ME49 strain). We have also incorporated into this release the genomic sequence of <i>T. gondii</i> GT1 strain, provided by The Institute for Genome Research (TIGR). 
<!--As a result, we have focused on providing access to ... through the ToxoDB 4.0 site but have not completely reproduced all the functions in ToxoDB 3.0. Therefore we have kept the ToxoDB 3.0 site fully active for continued use. -->
<p>
ToxoDB 4.0 includes:
<ul>
<li>A new interactive genome browser, based on the GBrowse module of the GMOD project, providing rapid visualization of the parasite genome and gene models, custom restriction site identification, open reading frame identification, and downloads in various formats.
<li>The genome sequence for T. gondii GT1 strain (from TIGR).
<li><i>T. gondii</i> ME49 strain annotation, including manual annotation from Toxoplasma Genome Sequencing Project; updated GO term curation.
<li>TIGR Gene Indices for <i>T. gondii</i>.
<li>New ortholog analyses, using the OrthoMCL algorithm to group genes from <i>T. gondii</i> with other complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (Chen et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 34:D363; 2006).
</ul>
</p>
<p>The release represents a complete restructuring of this database resource. 
We have eliminated the practice of using flat files as a means of data storage, upgraded to use the Genomics Unified Schema (GUS) database system and populated an underlying Oracle database in a systematic fashion. 
Additionally, we have employed the new Web Development Kit (WDK), dramatically changing the way the web site operates under the hood. 
This transformation conforms to the model used by all <a href="http://www.apidb.org">ApiDB</a> projects; it will henceforth not only make it easier to generate future releases in short cycles, but these changes also ensure a consistent look and feel for all ApiDB projects, namely ToxoDB, <a href="http://www.cryptodb.org">CryptoDB</a>, and <a href="http://www.plasmodb.org">PlasmoDB</a> (supported by a Bioinformatics Resource Center contract from the US NIH / NIAID).</p>
<p>Further, note that not only can the users ask questions (by issuing queries), but the website also provides the improved functionality of combining queries together and/or downloading the results in a customizable manner.</p>

OrthoMCL is an algorithm developed to identify orthologs and recent paralogs based on whole genome comparison of protein sequences (Li et al Genome Res. 13:2178; 2003). Previously, OrthoMCL groups were based on comparison of only 16 species in ToxoDB 3.3. In the current release, OrthoMCL groups were generated with 61 species. These species include the 55 used to generate orthologs groups at the <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi">OrthoMCL DB site</a> plus <i>P. vivax, Leishmania major, T. brucei, T. cruzi, Apis mellifera</i> (honeybee) and <i>S. purpatus</i> (sea urchin).
