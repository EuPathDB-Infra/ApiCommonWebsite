We are pleased to announce a workshop taught as part of a collaboration between the Pathogen Genomics Group 
(Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), the Eukaryotic Pathogen Bioinformatics Resource Center 
(University of Georgia and University of Pennsylvania, US), and the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute (US). 
This residential workshop aims to provide experimental biologists with hands-on experience in 
genomic-scale data analysis, including genome browsers and comparison tools, methods for 
data integration, and resources for sophisticated data mining.
Many examples and exercises will be drawn from the kinetoplastida, including <i>Leishmania spp.</i>, 
<i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, and <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, although applicants working on other protozoan 
parasites will also benefit.<br><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

New features include:
    <ul>
	<li>records for 756 <i>Cryptosporidium</i> isolates. Queries are available for searching isolate records by ID,  
host of origin, isolate species, and several other characteristics.  
For the full set of search options, see the "Identify Isolates by:"  
category on the web site's front page. Multiple isolate sequences can  
be readily aligned with ClustalW from the query result page.
<li>also included are 27,498 <i>C. muris</i> oocyst ESTs aligned to the <i>C. muris</i> 
draft genome.
<li>alignments of contigs of <i>C. parvum</i>, <i>C. muris</i> and <i>C. hominis</i> have been  
remade using the Mercator orthology mapping program and the MAVID  
multiple global alignment program. These alignments are available in

         A preliminary assembly of <i>C. muris</i> was obtained at approximately 
         4.5 X coverage, and
reveals a ~9Mb genome with average cytosine-guanine content (%GC) of ~28.5
%. This assembly is based on ~50,000 reads obtained mostly from a
small-insert library and a fosmid library. This assembly is estimated to
contain ~ 92% of the ~9Mb genome, and consists of 927 contigs arranged into
595 scaffolds.
<p>
Final assembly, to be released in late summer, will include an additional 2X
coverage obtained from a medium insert library and possibly >5X additional
coverage obtained with 454 pyrosequencing technology. The final assembly is
expected to contain > 99% of the genome.
<p>
Sequencing from the cDNA library provided by Giovanni Widmer is underway.
Average insert length is 1,600 bp. If the library is shown to be random, an
expected >30,000 EST reads will be obtained.

<ul>
<li>Proteomics data provided by two labs (Wastling, et al. (updated from CryptoDB 3.4) and Snelling, et al. (new data)) have been loaded, and 
these are visible on the Genome Sequence Browser. Queries to find genes, or ORFs, that show evidence of protein expression based on Mass Spec analyses are also available.</li>
<li><i>C. muris</i> contigs from first draft assembly and translated open reading frames.</li>
<li>Interproscan analysis of <i>Cryptosporidium</i> proteins.</li>
</ul>
<p>
New features in CryptoDB 3.5:
<ul>
<li>We have added <a href="showXmlDataContent.do?name=XmlQuestions.Tutorials">tutorial movies</a> to help you learn about the functionality of our site. 
If there are additional tutorials you would like to see added please submit a request via our <a href="help.jsp">support page</a>.</li>
<li>Most of the queries have been reorganized to make them more intuitive. Some include a new "Advanced Parameters" section. See for example "Identify Genes based on EST evidence."
<li>The columns displayed in query result pages are improved.  The result pages also offer options for sorting, adding new columns, and moving columns around.
<li>Downloading results is improved. A choice of formats is provided including tab-delimited, text, GFF, and FASTA to meet different needs.
  <ul>
  <li>Tab delimited provides an expanded list of annotations that can be directly exported as an Excel spreadsheet.
  <li>Text provides a detailed summary for each gene including protein structures, notes, sequence, and many other choices.
  <li> GFF is a format recognized by many applications such as the genome browser, gbrowse.
  <li> FASTA also provides a common format used for BLAST and other applications. The FASTA option provides the functionality of the SRT (sequence retrieval tool).

<li>
The site now offers a query history (accessible via the link in the toolbar) through which you may build on simple queries to create more complex combinations. There is also an option to download query results as plain text. This option is available on the search results and query history pages.
</li>
<li>
New queries for ESTs and genes by protein molecular weight have been added.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://cryptodb.org:1555">CryptoCyc</a>, a database of computationally predicted metabolic pathways for <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, is available online and is cross-referenced on the gene and contig pages of CryptoDB.

CryptoDB is one of NIAID's Bioinformatics Resource Centers (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/brc/default.htm">BRC</a>)  for Biodefense and Emerging or Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases. As part of our efforts for interoperability among the other BRCs and the research community in general we have released the published <i>Cryptosporidium</i> genome features in standardized GFF3 format. The files may be downloaded via FTP from <a href="ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/brc/ApiDB/Cryptosporidium/">ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/brc/ApiDB/Cryptosporidium/</a>.

        CryptoDB is now part of an NIH/NIAID funded Bioinformatics Resource Center 
        to provide Apicomplexan Database Resources. This release represents a major 
        upgrade of the database software and as a result we can provide greater 
        search power. We now offer searches by gene and contig name in addition 
        to key word and protein features. Results are displayed graphically and 
        provide additional useful information for each gene or contig. We have 
        added a GBrowse display that allows you to zoom in to the nucleotide level 
        and we have added a comparative GBrowse view comparing <i>C. parvum</i> 
        and <i>C. hominis</i> contigs. Please explore the site and provide feedback 
        and suggestions to <a href="mailto:help@cryptodb.org">help@cryptodb.org</a>.
