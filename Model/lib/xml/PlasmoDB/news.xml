<b>We are pleased to report that the following Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) have been awarded in connection with the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC):</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>The Toxoplasma oocyst transcriptome and proteome</b><br>
   John Boothroyd, Matt Bogyo (Stanford) & Pat Conrad (UC Davis)<br>
   This project is expected to yield expression data from an important, but inaccessible, life cycle stage (1 yr). <br><br></li>
<li><b>A comprehensive catalog of the T. gondii & N. caninum parasite & infected host cell transcriptome & proteome</b><br>
   Brian Gregory (Univ. Pennsylvania) & Jonathan Wastling (Univ. Liverpool)<br>
   This project will produce an immense volume of sequence data, driving database improvements for handling 'next-gen' sequencing, non-coding RNAs, and interrogating host & pathogen datasets in parallel (2 yr).<br><br></li>

<li><b>Dissection of Plasmodium falciparum genetic crosses by mass spectrometry-based metabolite QTL</b><br>
   Manuel Llin&aacute;s (Princeton) & Michael Ferdig (Notre Dame)<br>
   This project is expected to improve handling of genetic mapping data, incorporation of metabolomics results (integrated with pathway maps), and linking of specific genetic loci with metabolite abundance (2 yr).<br><br></li>
</ul>

A biennial competition for DBP awards is mandated by the BRC contract from NIH/NIAID, and supported by a total of $1.2M in total costs per award cycle.  The goal of this program is to produce high value genomic-scale datasets for the EuPathDB user community, and drive the further development of bioinformatics resources for data analysis and mining.<br><br>

Letters of intent (LOI) were solicited in February (see Feb 4 News item), and reviewed by the EuPathDB Scientific Working Group (SWG; see News, March 31).  12 full applications were solicited from among the ~50 LOIs received, and awards were based on further scientific review by the SWG, and in consultation with NIAID program staff.  Cost negotiations and 'in kind' contributions from other sources made it possible to support 3 applications, from 6 investigators (in some cases, more than one LOI was merged into a single award).<br><br>

We received far more high quality proposals than could be supported, testifying to the need for such mechanisms for data production bioinformatics analysis.  The EuPathDB team looks forward to working with members of our user community who are seeking funding for such projects from external sources.  Inquiries, including requests for support letters, should be directed to the EuPathDB staff (click on the 'Contact Us' link).<br><br>

<b>A new solicitation for DBPs is anticipated in 2011, and will be announced on the EuPathDB web site.</b>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Features introduced this year:<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Basket"</span> allows one to cherry pick genes and add them to
the basket for subsequent conversion into a step in a strategy.
&nbsp;The basket is accessible from the gray menu bar and the
number of items in your basket is indicated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weighted
searches</span>&nbsp;allows you to assign an arbitrary weight
to the searches (steps) in
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list
of your results. &nbsp;</li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of
the
same strategy looking for putative vaccine candidates. &nbsp;Notice
that you
have a larger number of results with weighting and those can be sorted
based on the sum of the weights, giving a ranked list of results.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/im.do?s=0fdc12df42cc3c61">Putative
vaccine candidates (unweighted)</a><br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/im.do?s=4d4df392a0952327">Putative&nbsp;</a><a
 href="http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/im.do?s=4d4df392a0952327">vaccine
candidates</a><a
 href="http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/im.do?s=4d4df392a0952327">
(Weighted)</a></div>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Favorites"</span> (new in this release) allows you to bookmark
and organize genes you
access frequently. &nbsp;A tutorial on how to use this feature is
available <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org/tutorials/Favorites/favorites_viewlet_swf.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li>We now provide prominent linkouts to GeneDB from PlasmoDB
gene pages when there is an update in GeneDB not yet available in
PlasmoDB. &nbsp;This feature enables PlasmoDB users to have easy
access to the most up-to-date information. &nbsp;It is important to
highlight that your comments on gene pages in PlasmoDB constitute one
of the tools made available to the annotators at GeneDB to improve and
enhance the genome annotation.</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Feature evaluators still needed:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome you to *sign
up* to be an early evaluator of new features on the EuPathDB sites.
This will be an opportunity for you to help us refine and improve
features early in the development process.&nbsp;In fact, the "My
Favorites" feature was the subject of our first survey and feature
evaluator's comments and suggestions contributed to enhancing this
feature. <br>
<br>
Signing on is easy and will
require minimal effort on your part in the form of answering questions
or rendering your opinion. &nbsp;<br>

         <![CDATA[Dear all,<br>
<br>
The PlasmoDB team would like to alert you to two important issues
concerning the presentation of <span style="font-style: italic;">P.
falciparum</span> microarray data in PlasmoDB.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; Beginning with PlasmoDB 6.0 all profiles using the
Winzeler Affymetrix scrMalaria array were updated to reflect the latest
3D7 genome annotation. Previously, probes were mapped to the P.
falciparum 3D7 genome annotation released in July 2001.&nbsp; The
array was originally designed with a tiling of probes, so the new
annotation has resulted in many genes gaining new probes which did not
previously map to the gene, and dropping old probes which no longer map
(Note: The new mapping allowed up to two mismatches per probe, and only
probes which mapped uniquely, up to two mismatches, were
retained).&nbsp; Previous gene expression profiles were generated
using the MOID algorithm with the 2001 annotation, while the current
profiles were generated using RMA with the new annotation.&nbsp;
Many of the expression profiles exhibit minor differences and a
few&nbsp;changed significantly.&nbsp; Such differences are
expected and should result in a more accurate representation of the
data.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp; An internal error with one the files concerning the P.
falciparum 3D7 gametocyte expression data was discovered.&nbsp;
This error appeared with the release of PlasmoDB 6.0 in July of 2009
and was fixed on October 20th, 2009.&nbsp; Also, please note that
probe remapping and MOID vs. RMA analysis differences described above
also apply to this data set.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
We regret any disruption this may cause you.&nbsp; Please do not
hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
The PlasmoDB Team

We are pleased to announce the release of the fifth snapshot of the reannotation of the <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 genome.
<p>
The effort to systematically update the annotation for <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 genome started in October 2007 with a weeklong workshop co-organized by staff from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and the EuPathDB team. The Wellcome Trust and Burroughs Wellcome Fund-sponsored workshop was held in Hinxton, UK and was attended by nearly 30 Plasmodium researchers contributing expertise in various aspects of Plasmodium biology, plus more than 10 bioinformatics support staff from the Artemis, GeneDB and EuPathDB teams.  Ongoing annotation and error checking is being carried out by the GeneDB group from WTSI.

<p>
The effort to systematically update the annotation for <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 genome started in October 2007 with a weeklong workshop co-organized by staff from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and the ApiDB team. The Wellcome Trust and Burroughs Wellcome Fund-sponsored workshop was held in Hinxton, UK and was attended by nearly 30 Plasmodium researchers contributing expertise in various aspects of Plasmodium biology, plus more than 10 bioinformatics support staff from the Artemis, GeneDB and ApiDB teams. During the workshop 2700 genes were edited using Artemis and ACT software, mainly with the addition of new or alternative functional descriptions (e.g. product names, GO terms, EC numbers and miscellaneous textual comments).

 
<p>

After the workshop, intensive manual reannotation of the genome has continued at WTSI with the help of several members of the community. First, the structures of more than 700 gene models have been changed and new gene models have been added. In addition, curation staff at GeneDB have reviewed all User Comments submitted to PlasmoDB. Over the coming months, the emphasis will switch to a careful genome-wide review of functional annotation.

 
<p>
The annotation presented here in PlasmoDB is the second snapshot of a work in progress and intended to inform you about the new annotation and elicit any feedback that you may have. Please add a User Comment to any gene about which you have additional information. This information is forwarded to the GeneDB curators on a weekly basis and will be included in the next snapshot.  In order to expedite the annotation, the following are of particular value to the manual curators: 
<ul>
<li> New product names with the PubMed ID of the paper in which they were first cited, 

<li> Additional PubMed IDs of any papers from which the function of the gene/protein can be ascribed

<li> EC number

<li> Alternative/updated gene names and aliases.

<li> Evidence that a gene structure has been incorrectly called.  Please include a description of the evidence that you have used (e.g. full length cDNA) and the new sequence. 
</ul>
 
<p>
The ongoing reannotation is being systematically carried out by Ulrike B&#246;hme and Bart Barrell (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute) with extensive help from several community volunteers, in particular Chris Newbold (Oxford, UK), Tom Templeton (Cornell, US), Eric Mar&#233;chal (Grenoble, France).  For the annotation, the Artemis software was redesigned by Tim Carver and changes are recorded within a Chado database (GeneDB) designed and maintained by Adrian Tivey and Chinmay Patel.

The effort to re-annotate the <i>falciparum</i> genome was started in October at a weeklong workshop co-organized by ApiDB and GeneDB staff.  The workshop was hosted at the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK and was attended by nearly 30 <i>Plasmodium</i> researchers contributing expertise in various aspects of <i>Plasmodium</i> biology and more than 10 bioinformatics support staff from the GeneDB and ApiDB teams. More than 2,700 genes have been reviewed to date and most modified in some fashion; primarily refining exon boundaries, assigning product names, assigning GO functions and EC numbers and making comments / notes.  The annotation process is continuing in the attempt to review all genes at least twice (by different annotators).  The annotation presented here in PlasmoDB is thus a work in progress and intended to inform you, the community, about the new annotation and elicit any feedback that you may have.  Please add a user comment to any gene that you have additional information about.  This includes supporting data corroborating gene annotation as well as data that indicates the gene model, product name, functional assignments etc are incorrect.  These comments will be included in the annotation which we hope will be concluded in mid-march.

The ApiDB team is pleased to announce the release of PlasmoDB_5.4.

<br><br><u>New data include:</u>
<ul>
<li> A slightly modified reference genome for <i>P. falciparum</i> (several gaps have been closed on chr10 & 11).
<li> P. berghei gametocyte proteomics data (Khan et al, Cell 121:675-87).
<li> Many additional <i>P. falciparum</i> SNPs (unpublished data from the Broad Inst).
<li> Additional ESTs (Watanabe et al, Nucl Acids Res 32:D334-8; Lu et al, BMC Genomics 8:255; Florent et al, Mol.Biochem.Parasitol. 135:143-8)
<li> Expression profiling data for antigenic and adherent variants of <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7 (Mok et al, Molec Biochem Parasitol 151:184-92).
<li> User comments submitted prior to June 2007 have now been incorporated into the official annotation.
<li> Sequence assemblies for 11 <i>falciparum</i> strains from the Broad Institute have just been released and are available on the PlasmoDB download site.
</ul>

<u>New features include:</u>
<ul>
<li> Faster loading of Gene and Genome Browser pages. 
<li> Improved synteny views in the Genome Browser.
<li> Browser views of rodent malaria genomes colored to indicate chromosomes (Kooij et al, PLoS Pathog 1:e44). 
<li> Gene page links to various external data sources (including PlasmoMAP,  TDRtargets, UCSC <i>P. falciparum</i> genome browser, Ontology-based Pattern Identification and literature databases).
<li> More convenient access to help ... please click the "Ask us a Question" link on the left of every page, or the "Contact Us" at bottom to report problems or suggest improvements to the database.
</ul>

Note that a mechanism has now been established to ensure that User Comments on genes or sequences are incorporated into the official annotation in a timely manner.  In response to a banner posted on PlasmoDB and e-mail to malaria researchers, several hundred new User Comments were entered by the community in advance of a <i>P. falciparum</i> genome reannotation workshop jointly sponsored by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Inst and the PlasmoDB team during the week of Oct 21!
<br><br>
There is still time to enter additional User Comments while the updated annotation is being reviewed in preparation for deposition in GenBank and release on PlasmoDB and GeneDB in early 2008.  Please use the User Comments feature as a repository for valuable information on:
<ul>
<li> Naming, e.g. "Apical membrane antigen 1 is also known as AMA1, AMA-1, Pf83, Rhoptry Membrane Antigen, RMA1" or "this gene is now recognizable as XXX based on Pfam domain ###."
<li> Gene models, e.g. "Corrected cDNA sequence for gene XXX: &lt;sequence&gt;, based on RACE and primer extension for 5' UTR and polyA-tailed cDNA clone for 3' UTR" or "RT-PCR confirms annotated CDS sequence as correct."  Note that confirmation of existing annotation can be as valuable as corrections!
<li> Function, e.g. "Enzymatic activity for gene XXX has been confirmed" or "Protein XXX is predicted to target to the apicoplast, but an epitope-tagged construct shows cytoplasmic localization."  Be sure to provide name and/or PubMedID if available.
</ul>

For data that is not readily accommodated in this form, or datasets too extensive to enter as individual User Comments (expression profiling studies, systematic evaluation of gene models by RT-PCR, etc), please contact support@PlasmoDB.org.

Best regards,
<br>

       <attribute name="item">
           
          <![CDATA[
PlasmoDB 5.3 provides the genome and annotation for the primate malarial parasite <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i>, provided by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Pathogen Sequencing Unit. This brings the number of Plasmodium genomes available for queries at PlasmoDB up to six. Also provided are expression data from recent papers using gene knockouts to study molecular mechanisms in human (<i>P. falciparum</i>) and rodent (<i>P. berghei</i>) malarial parasites. Queries have been developed for the new expression studies and a summary graphic (P.f.) or table (P.b.) added to the gene pages.
<p>
The PlasmoDB 5.3 web site also has significant improvements to the query and results pages. Many of the queries have been reorganized. For example, the Predicted Functional Interaction query now allows input of a list of genes and a clearer explanation of what to get from the query (e.g., find high confidence predicted interactions between members of the input gene list). The results from this and all queries can be sorted. It is also now possible to add columns of interest (e.g., protein features, GO annotation, even expression characteristics) and sort on them.
<p>
New data and queries in PlasmoDB 5.3:
<ul>
<li>Genome sequence and annotation for <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Pathogen Sequencing Unit.  <i>P. knowlesi</i> is included in many of the queries to identify genes, genomics sequences, ESTs, and ORFs by various features.
<li>Microarray studies have been incorporated from a series of 3 papers on gene silencing (Duraisingh et al. Cell 2005) and invasion pathways (Baum et al. PLoS Pathogens 2005; Stubbs et al. Science 2005) in <i>P. falciparum</i>.
<li>A microarray study in <i>P. berghei</i> from a paper on translational repression in gametocytes (Mair et al. Science 2006).
<li>A refined mapping of epitopes to <i>Plasmodium</i> provided by the <a href="http://www.immuneepitope.org/home.do">Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource</a>. A query is now provided to identify genes whose encoding protein has an epitope at different levels of confidence.
<li>Updated E.C. number and metabolic pathway assignments, Interpro protein domains and associated GO predictions, MR4 reagent links, homologies to entries in the NRDB protein database and links to stuctures in PDB.
<li>A new build of ortholog groups from Orthomcl for use in PlasmoDB. The list of genomes represented has increased from 55 to 87  and includes all the organisms covered by the different NIH/NIAID funded Bioinformatics Resource Centers.
</ul>
<p>
New features in PlasmoDB 5.3:
<ul>
<li>Most of the queries have been reorganized to make them more intuitive. Some include a new "Advanced Parameters" section. See for example "Identify Genes based on EST evidence."
<li>The columns displayed in query result pages are improved.  The result pages also offer options for sorting, adding new columns, and moving columns around.
<li>Downloading results is improved. A choice of formats is provided including tab-delimited, text, GFF, and FASTA to meet different needs.
  <ul>
  <li>Tab delimited provides an expanded list of annotations that can be directly exported as an Excel spreadsheet.
   <li>Text provides a detailed summary for each gene including SNPs, Y2H interactions, metabolic pathways, MR4 reagents, protein structures, notes, sequence, and many other choices.
   <li> GFF is a format recognized by many applications such as the genome browser, gbrowse.
  <li> FASTA also provides a common format used for BLAST and other applications. The FASTA option provides the functionality of the SRT (sequence retrieval tool) found in earlier versions of PlasmoDB.

February, 2007  The PFGRC announces that it will conduct a four day course titled, "Introduction to Microarray Technology", April 16-19, 2007.
<p>
The NIAID sponsored Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center at TIGR announces that it will conduct a four day course titled, "Introduction to Microarray Technology." The workshop will be held on the TIGR campus on April 16-19, 2007. The course will provide an overview of the two-dye spotted microarray platform. The course is designed for hands on participation and attendees will actively learn to make the most of their microarrays through a combination of wet lab and bioinformatics sessions.
<p>
The wet lab portion will be taught by PFGRC staff who are directly involved in microarray production. Participants will be guided through probe preparation and hybridization protocols. The training will also consist of detailed discussions on dye coupling, slide pre-hybridization, hybridization, and scanning techniques. Other topics for discussion will include the importance of assessing source material and probe quality, comparisons of various slide surfaces, and printing techniques.
<p>
The bioinformatics portion of the course covers an introduction to the stages of microarray data analysis. Major topics include data management, image analysis, normalization, and data mining. Fundamental data analysis concepts will be taught using a mix of lectures and interactive hands-on sessions. Participants will analyze the microarrays they prepared, using the open-source TM4 software suite while working closely with the software developers.

PlasmoDB 5.2 brings a new emphasis on genetic markers, in the form of four new datasets relating to <i>Plasmodium</i> polymorphisms.  This data is available in the Genome Browser, on the Gene page and in queries.  We continue to move key data from the PlasmoDB 4.4 site to the current site: this release re-introduces gametocyte expression data and expression profile similarity search. The Gene page now includes matches to Interpro protein domains and the Genome Browser offers tracks ESTs from dbEST.
<p>
The PlasmoDB 5.2 site also includes new features such as allowing you to keep your Query History for later use, an improved keyword search and a significantly upgraded Query & Tools page.
<p>

New data and queries in PlasmoDB 5.2:
<ul>
<li> Array data from <i>Kidgell et al. PLoS Pathogens 2006 A systematic map  of genetic variation in Plasmodium falciparum</i>.

We are pleased to announce the first full release of the Plasmodium Genome Database, Version 5.0, now as www.plasmodb.org.  (Many of you have had a chance to explore the beta-release version as v5-0.plasmodb.org).  
<p>
PlasmoDB 5.0 implements significant 'under-the-hood' changes, making it much easier to generate future releases in short cycles.  In addition, these changes to ensure a consistent look for all <a href="http://www.apidb.org">ApiDB</a> projects, including PlasmoDB, <a href="http://www.cryptodb.org">CryptoDB</a>, and <a href="http://www.toxodb.org">ToxoDB</a> (supported by a Bioinformatics Resource Center contract from the US NIH / NIAID).
<p>

Because it will take some time to implement all of the PlasmoDB 4.4 functionality in the new architecture, <a href="http://v4-4.plasmodb.org">PlasmoDB 4.4</a> remains active, and the results of queries run under it may be exported to PlasmoDB 5.0 (see <a href="http://v4-4.plasmodb.org/plasmodb/servlet/sv?page=history">PlasmoDB 4.4 Query History</a>).
<p>

New Data in PlasmoDB 5.0 (relative to version 4.4) include:
<ul>
  <li>the complete genome sequence for P. vivax Salvador, along with a complete set of annotated gene models

  <li>the complete genome sequence for P. berghei, along with a complete set of annotated gene models

  <li>the complete genome sequence for P. chabaudi, along with a complete set of annotated gene models

  <li>TIGR Gene Indices for <i>P. vivax</i>, <i>P. falciparum</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i>

  <li>protein-protein interaction data, based on a genome-wide yeast 2-hybrid analysis (LaCount et al. Nature 438:103; 2005)

  <li>new ortholog analyses, using the OrthoMCL algorithm to group genes from several Plasmodium species with other complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (Chen et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 34:D363; 2006)

  <li>Computational predictions for functional interactions in <i>P. falciparum</i> from the PlasmoMAP project are provided based on co-evolution and co-expression of genes (Date & Stoeckert Genome Res. 16:542; 2006). This data is now available as a PlasmoDB query.

  <li>Updated mappings for pathways and Enzyme Classifications (EC).
</ul>
<p>

New Features in PlasmoDB 5.0 Include:
<ul>
 <li>an interactive genome browser, based on the GBrowse module of the GMOD project
 <li>syntenic relationships between <i>P. falciparum</i>, <i>P. vivax</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i> (Carlton et al., Nature 419:512; 2002).
</ul>
<p>

     Finally, we are pleased to report a new CD-ROM version of the Plasmodium Genome Database.  PlasmoCD provides users lacking reliable high-speed internet connections with full access to the complete genomes of <i>P. falciparum</i>, <i>P. vivax</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i>, along with gene models, annotation, BLAST hits, ortholog results, expression data, and search functions for querying and integrating these results across species.

 We are pleased to announce Version 5.0 Beta of the Plasmodium Genome Database. We have incorporated into PlasmoDB the new release of the <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> genome and annotation generated by Jane Carlton's group and the sequencing center at The Institute for Genome Research. We have also used this release to change the way we create the web site and underlying database that should make it easier for us to generate new PlasmoDB releases and be consistent with other ApiDB projects such as CryptoDB and ToxoDB. As a result, we have focused on providing access to <i>P. vivax</i> through the PlasmoDB 5.0 Beta site but have not completely reproduced all the functions in PlasmoDB 4.4. Therefore we have kept the PlasmoDB 4.4 site fully active for continued use. Furthermore we have provided a mechanism to take the results of a PlasmoDB 4.4 query and use it in PlasmoDB 5.0 Beta. 
<p>
PlasmoDB 5.0 Beta features:
<ul>
<li>A new interactive genome browser, based on the GBrowse module of the GMOD project, providing rapid visualization of the parasite genome and gene models, custom restriction site identification, open reading frame identification, and downloads in various formats.
<li>The complete genome sequence for P. vivax Salvador, along with a complete set of annotated gene models, and syntenic relationships between <i>P. falciparum, P. vivax</i>, and <i>P. yoelii</i> (from Jane Carlton, TIGR).
<li>Updated <i>P. falciparum</i> annotation, including curated literature citations; updated GO term curation from Andy Berry, Matt Berriman, and the Sanger curation effort; updated EC/pathway mappings from Hagai Ginsburg.
<li>TIGR Gene Indices for <i>P. vivax, P. falciparum, and P.yoelii</i>.
<li>Corrected expression profiles from glass-slide arrays for <i>P. falciparum</i> 3D7, HB3 & Dd2 (from Manuel Llinas, Zybnek Bozdech & Joe DeRisi).
<li>Updated structural data, including information from the structural genomics consortia.
<li>Protein-protein interaction data for <i>P. falciparum</i>, based on a genome-wide yeast 2-hybrid analysis (LaCount et al. Nature 438:103; 2005).
<li>New ortholog analyses, using the OrthoMCL algorithm to group genes from several <i>Plasmodium</i> species with other complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (Chen et al. Nucl Acids Res, in press).

The expression profiles obtained from Joe DeRisi's group (UCSF) are processed by the PlasmoDB team for generating the images on the expression pages and for use in the expression profile queries. The orginal HB3 data were processed without background subtraction while the more recent 3D7 and DD2 data were processed with background subtraction. These have now all been processed consistently in the following manner.<p>
Raw data were loess normalized using the default loess implementation in the R package for microarray analysis (marray).  The non-background corrected foreground mean was used as input to the loess algorithm. Replicate arrays for the same time point were then averaged to give one value for each timepoint/gene. Data was then smoothed using a least squares fit to each data point and its two neighbors on each side.<p>
The profiles seen in PlasmoDB 4.4 have also been corrected. The correlation table that gives correlations between the different studies (the three DeRisi and the two Winzeler) has been recalculated based on the new profiles.  This new data is not yet displayed on 4.4 but will be on 5.0 Beta.
