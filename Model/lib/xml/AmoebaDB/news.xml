<b>We are pleased to report that the following Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) have been awarded in connection with the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC):</b><br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>The Toxoplasma oocyst transcriptome and proteome</b><br>
   John Boothroyd, Matt Bogyo (Stanford) & Pat Conrad (UC Davis)<br>
   This project is expected to yield expression data from an important, but inaccessible, life cycle stage (1 yr). <br><br></li>
<li><b>A comprehensive catalog of the T. gondii & N. caninum parasite & infected host cell transcriptome & proteome</b><br>
   Brian Gregory (Univ. Pennsylvania) & Jonathan Wastling (Univ. Liverpool)<br>
   This project will produce an immense volume of sequence data, driving database improvements for handling 'next-gen' sequencing, non-coding RNAs, and interrogating host & pathogen datasets in parallel (2 yr).<br><br></li>

<li><b>Dissection of Plasmodium falciparum genetic crosses by mass spectrometry-based metabolite QTL</b><br>
   Manuel Llin&aacute;s (Princeton) & Michael Ferdig (Notre Dame)<br>
   This project is expected to improve handling of genetic mapping data, incorporation of metabolomics results (integrated with pathway maps), and linking of specific genetic loci with metabolite abundance (2 yr).<br><br></li>
</ul>

A biennial competition for DBP awards is mandated by the BRC contract from NIH/NIAID, and supported by a total of $1.2M in total costs per award cycle.  The goal of this program is to produce high value genomic-scale datasets for the EuPathDB user community, and drive the further development of bioinformatics resources for data analysis and mining.<br><br>

Letters of intent (LOI) were solicited in February (see Feb 4 News item), and reviewed by the EuPathDB Scientific Working Group (SWG; see News, March 31).  12 full applications were solicited from among the ~50 LOIs received, and awards were based on further scientific review by the SWG, and in consultation with NIAID program staff.  Cost negotiations and 'in kind' contributions from other sources made it possible to support 3 applications, from 6 investigators (in some cases, more than one LOI was merged into a single award).<br><br>

We received far more high quality proposals than could be supported, testifying to the need for such mechanisms for data production bioinformatics analysis.  The EuPathDB team looks forward to working with members of our user community who are seeking funding for such projects from external sources.  Inquiries, including requests for support letters, should be directed to the EuPathDB staff (click on the 'Contact Us' link).<br><br>

<b>A new solicitation for DBPs is anticipated in 2011, and will be announced on the EuPathDB web site.</b>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce the release of AmoebaDB 1.2<br>
<br>
<br>
This release of AmoebaDB includes the following new data set:</span><span
style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
</span>
<ul>
<li>Proteomics data from <span style="font-style: italic;">E.
histolytica </span>phagosomes of various degrees of maturation
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211552/">Boettner
et. al.</a>).&nbsp; This data can be searched in AmoebaDB from the <a
href="http://amoebadb.org/amoeba/showQuestion.do?questionFullName=GeneQuestions.GenesByMassSpec">Mass
Spec. search page</a> and results can be integrated with other search
types.&nbsp; An example search strategy that integrates different
search types can be viewed <a
href="http://amoebadb.org/amoeba/im.do?s=3a0c08bd343b2607">here</a>.&nbsp;
This strategy asks for all <span style="font-style: italic;">E.
histolytica</span> genes&nbsp; with phagosome proteomic evidence, that
contain transmembrane domains and&nbsp; contain a "kinase" PFAM
domain.&nbsp; <br>
</li>
<li>Gene that have evidence of protein expression also have a
graphical representation of the peptide hits on their respective gene
pages (mousing over the graphics provides additional information such
as peptide sequence).&nbsp; Here is a link to a gene page with
proteomics evidence -- scroll down to the "Protein" section and show
"Protein features".&nbsp; Note that samples are color coded.<br>
</li>
<li>Proteomics data can also be visualized in the genome
browser.&nbsp; This <a

</span>
<ul>
<li>Gene expression in <span style="font-style: italic;">Entamoeba

</li>
</ul>
Genes can be identified based on the fold change in their expression in
either of the above experiments using the microarray search available
in AmoebaDB (under the heading "Transcript Expression).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In addition, AmoebaDB now has a logo!&nbsp; Template images used in
AmoebaDB were kindly provided by Graham Clark, Fiona Henriquez, William

<body>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We are pleased to
announce new features in AmoebaDB 1.0<br>
<br>
<br>
In an effort to continue improving the utility of&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">AmoebaDB</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> we have
implemented several new features in recent releases. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
</span>
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Basket"</span> allows one to cherry pick genes and add them to
the basket for subsequent conversion into a step in a strategy.
&nbsp;The basket is accessible from the gray menu bar and the
number of items in your basket is indicated.</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Weighted
searches</span>&nbsp;allows you to assign an arbitrary weight
to the searches (steps) in
your search strategy making it possible for you to view a ranked list
of your results. &nbsp;</li>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Here is an example of
the
same strategy looking for putative secreted enzymes. &nbsp;Notice
that you
have a larger number of results with weighting and those can be sorted
based on the sum of the weights, giving a ranked list of results.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://amoebadb.org/amoeba/im.do?s=1f1149b09f8bdb94">Putative
secreted enzymes (unweighted)</a><br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://amoebadb.org/amoeba/im.do?s=49f654c9c61fd4e1">Putative
secreted enzymes (Weighted)</a></div>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"My
Favorites"</span> allows you to bookmark and organize genes you
access frequently. &nbsp;A tutorial on how to use this feature is
available <a
 href="http://eupathdb.org/tutorials/Favorites/favorites_viewlet_swf.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Feature evaluators still needed:<br>
<br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">We welcome you to *sign
up* to be an early evaluator of new features on the EuPathDB sites.
This will be an opportunity for you to help us refine and improve
features early in the development process.&nbsp;In fact, the "My
Favorites" feature was the subject of our first survey and feature
evaluator's comments and suggestions contributed to enhancing this
feature. <br>
<br>
Signing on is easy and will
require minimal effort on your part in the form of answering questions
or rendering your opinion. &nbsp;<br>

We are pleased to announced the full release of AmoebaDB 1.0 
(<a href="http://amoebadb.org">http://amoebadb.org</a> or <a href="http://amebadb.org">http://amebadb.org</a>). &nbsp;<br> 
Leveraging bioinformatics infrastructure developed in the context of the EuPathDB project (including PlasmoDB, etc), this resource 
incorporates genome sequence and annotation from the Pathema project. &nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>
Highlights include:</span>
<br><br> 
<ul> 
 <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sequence and annotation for</span> <i>Entamoeba histolytica, E. dispar and E. invadens</i>.</span></li> 
 <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Genome sequence alignments</span>, permitting comparative genomic analysis of synteny between <i>Entamoeba</i> species.</li> 
 <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Expressed sequence tag data</span> for <i>E.&nbsp;histolytica</i> and <i> E. dispar.</i></li> 
 <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">'User Comments'</span> may be added to any gene page, enhancing available annotation. 
        Such comments become immediately visible and searchable by others.</li> 
 <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Identification of genes</span> based on text terms, ID #, GO terms, EC #, chromosomal location, BLAST, 
        sequence features (length/MW, exons, signal sequences, Pfam domains, user-defined motifs), orthology, etc. </li> 
 <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Support for integrated searches</span>, via the 'search strategy builder'. &nbsp;Strategies can be stored and shared 
       with others by logging into AmoebaDB. For an example, <a href="http://amoebadb.org/amoeba/im.do?s=aed2d725b224ff13"><b>open this sample strategy</b></a> 
       that combines multiple searches, in your browser.</li>
