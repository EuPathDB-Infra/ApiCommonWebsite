EuPathDB (formerly ApiDB) is an integrated database 
covering the eukaryotic pathogens in the genera listed in our <a href="/a/processQuestion.do?questionFullName=OrganismQuestions.GenomeDataTypes">Data Summary</a> page.
<br>
While these organisms are supported by a taxon-specific database/website built upon the same infrastructure, the EuPathDB portal offers an 
entry point to all of these resources, and the opportunity to leverage orthology for searches across genera.
<br><br>
The EuPathDB databases are funded by NIAID and they have strict guidelines as to which organisms we can support.  EuPathDB is one of four <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/dmid/brc/Pages/default.aspx">NIH funded bioinformatics resource centers</a>.  Mainly we are to incorporate any eukaryotic pathogen that is deemed emerging or re-emerging (see <a href="http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/list.htm">list</a>).  We also have some organisms that are not on the list, those were either added in the past on the behest of the community and additional funding (such as TrichDB), organisms that are related to emerging or re-emerging pathogen (such as Plasmodium or Neospora) and the trypanosomatids (funded as a pilot project by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation).
<br><br>
The EuPathDB family of databases is expected to expand further over the coming years, incorporating new species including the Amoebozoa 
(Entamoeba, Acanthamoeba), Microsporidia, and additional Apicomplexans, Kinetoplastida and Diplomonads. 
Of course, we continue collecting data that are being deposited at an ever-increasing rate, including additional genome sequences, microarray data, probe-based hybridization and sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-chip and RNA-Seq), proteomics data, isolate data, phenotype information and metabolomic data.
<br><br>

<h4>EST Assemblies</h4>
EST assemblies are transcript predictions based on genome alignments. 
ESTs are obtained from dbEST and from researchers who generously provide 
additional libraries. ESTs are cleaned prior to use; leading or trailing 
poly A or T sequences are trimmed and vector sequences are masked. ESTs 
greater than 50 bases long are used for BLAT alignment (Kent,W.J, 2002. 
Genome Research. 12:656-664) to same species genome sequences with a 
threshold of 90% minimum sequence identity, minimum score of 30, and the 
maximum intron length adjusted for the species. The ESTs are then 
clustered into disjoint sets based on the proximity and quality of their 
alignments, only the best alignments with a 95% minimum percent identity 
are used for clustering. Clusters of ESTs are then assembled and 
consensus sequences produced using the CAP4 assembly program (X. Huang 
and Madan, A., 1999. Genome Res. 9:868-877). Finally, the predicted 
consensus transcripts are themselves aligned to the genome.

The Eukaryotic Pathogen Database (EuPathDB) has been developed as a Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC), with support from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Additional funding for a kinetoplastid component (TriTrypDB) was recently provided by the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> in coordination with independent support for kinetoplastid annotation from <a href=" https://wellcome.ac.uk">The Wellcome Trust</a>, with the latter entity funding 7FTEs within the EuPathDB project overall. 

The EuPathDB team is mainly distributed between the 
<a href="https://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a> Philadelphia, USA  
the <a href="http://www.uga.edu">University of Georgia</a>, Georgia, USA, and several members of the team are located at 
the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk">University of Liverpool</a>, United Kingdom, 
<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk">University of Glasgow</a>, United Kingdom 
and <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk">The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a>, United Kingdom.
