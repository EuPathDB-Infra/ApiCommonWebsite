!Text Search

Find genes whose "Gene Product" or "Annotated Notes" fields contain your text.  The search is case insensitive, for example both 'ACTIN' and 'actin' will work.  The fields must contain your text exactly.  Use '*' as a wildcard.  The wildcard can span several words. For example: "red*ase" will find "reductase" and "predicted lactate dehydrogenase".

For Plasmo: (On the Gene pages, the Notes are found in the Annotation section.)<br>
For Toxo: (On Gene pages, Notes are found in Toxoplasma Genome Sequencing Project Annotation)

Organism: Select one or more than one organism.
Keyword (Text?): The text you enter can consist of one word or several words. These words will be used to search for a match in the "Gene Product" or the "Annotated Notes" fields, with the words in that same exact order. You can use uppercase or lowercase, it does not matter. You can use "*" as a wildcard; "*" represents any sequence of letters. For example, "red*ase" will find "reductase" and "predcited lactate dehydrogenase".  


!Pfam

Find genes containing a given Pfam domain, family or repeat.  Type a Pfam name, accession or description. Use the Pfam browser to search Pfam if you are not sure.  The list below shows the descriptions mapped to PlasmoDB genes.

Organism: Select one or more than one organism.
Pfam Name, Pfam Accession Number or Pfam Description: you can select a Pfam family by typing its name, its accession number or its description. For more information on Pfam Domains visit LINK.


!EC Number

Find <i>P. falciparum </i> genes that have been assigned a particular Enzyme Commission (EC) number.http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/.  Use '-' in place of numbers to denote partial EC Numbers, for example, '2.7.7.-'.


E.C. numbers assignments for <i>P. falciparum</i> are from Andy Berry, Matt Berriman (Sanger Institute) and Hagai Ginsburg (Hebrew University).


Organism: Select one or more than one organism.
EC Number: Enzyme Commission numbers describe enzymes hierarchically by the class of reactions they catalize. For example: 2.7.7.6, 3.5.1.31.  Use '-' in place of numbers to denote partial EC Numbers, for example, '2.7.7.-'. http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/


!GO Term

Find genes by Gene Ontology (GO) term for molecular function, biological process or subcellular localization.  The search finds genes with the GO term you specify and genes with terms that are specializations of your term (is-a).  For a list of GO terms, we suggest using the AmiGO browser.  For GO IDs, include the GO prefix as in "GO:0003824."

Organism: Select one or more than one organism.
GO Term or GO ID: Enter a GO ID (e.g., "GO:0003824") or GO Term (e.g."catalytic activity"). The character "*" can be used as a wildcard
in a GO Term. (not for the ID?)


!BLAST
Find genes that have BLAST similarity to your input sequence. The search uses NCBI BLAST. _Please limit your input sequence to length 4000 (this will be corrected in an upcoming release)_

BLAST target database type: indicates the type of sequences in the target database: CDS, Protein or translated CDS. The selection of the program (blastn, blastp, tblastn, etc) depends on this parameter and the input sequence type.

BLAST target databse organism: select one organism to define the traget database.
BLAST input sequence: you can input a fasta format, the define will be ignored; please be aware that a this point sequences longer than 4000 characteres do not do well in our system. This will be fixed in the next release.
BLAST input sequence type: DNA or Protein.
Expectation value (E): as in WUBLAST.
Maximum descriptions (V):as in WUBLAST.
Maximum alignments (B):as in WUBLAST.




!Gene ID
Find a gene by ToxoDB Gene ID. The search is case insensitive. Wild card searches, e.g. ' 128.m* ', are permitted.

-----


!Gene Type
Find genes by type (eg, protein coding, tRNA, etc).

Gene type assignments are based on the gene annotations from TIGR.

!Signal Peptide
Find genes that are predicted to have a signal peptide.

The predictions are made with the SignalP program.
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/


!Exon Count
Find genes having at least the given number of exons.

Exon numbers are based on annotated gene models from TIGR.

!Transmembrane Domain Count
Find genes with at least a given number of transmembrane domains.

Transmembrane domains were predicted using TMHMM.

!Molecular Weight
Find genes whose protein product is within a molecular weight range.

Molecular weights are machine calculated from the raw translation and does not take into account any protein or residue modifications. For translations containing ambiguous amino acid codes (B, Z, X) we calculate the upper bound of the molecular weight. _fix for ~ToxoDB and ~PlasmoDB_

!Orthology Phylogenetic Profile
(_steve to rewrite_)
Find genes that have a specified orthology-based phylogenetic pattern. The phylogenetic profile of a gene is a series of 65 "present" or "absent" calls, reflecting the presence or absence of a putative ortholog in 65 genomes.

An <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi">OrthoMCL</a> analysis of the proteins of 65 species, including Plasmodia, placed each protein in an ortholog group. From a Plasmodium gene perspective, the other species that are included in that gene's ortholog group can be thought of as a phylogenetic profile.

 An OrthoMCL analysis of the proteins of 65 species, including Plasmodia, placed each protein in an ortholog group. From a Plasmodium gene perspective, the other species that are included in that gene's ortholog group can be thought of as a phyletic profile.

Use this query to define a pattern across ortholog groups, and find genes that match that pattern. The pattern is a specification, for each species, of "include", "exclude", or "don't care." Click on the radio button next to a species to toggle through the three states. (A means "include", an means "exclude" and means "don't care".)

For example, to find genes that are present in Apicomplexa but not in humans, click on Apicomplexa until you see a and click on Homo sapiens until you see an .

Note that this query can take some time because of the large number of combinations of possible presence/absence calls (265 possible combinations, of which 2487 are associated with a total of 30739 genes).


!Protein Motif Pattern
Find genes whose protein product contains a motif pattern that you specify.

Specify the pattern with a (Perl style) "regular expression". (Regular expressions are more powerful than PROSITE patterns.) For a description of how to create regular expressions, please see the Regular Expression Tutorial.

The following codes can be used to represent classes of amino acids.
(_include table_)


-----

!Isoelectric Point
Find genes whose protein product has an isoelectric point within the given range.

!Location or Genomic Region


!Metabolic Pathway
Find genes involved in specific metabolic pathway.

Metabolic Pathway Reconstruction for T. gondii is available on the KEGG Pathway site.

----

!Plasmodium species

Find genes from one or more Plasmodium species.

!PDB 3D Structures

Find genes with a 3D protein structure in the <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb">Protein Data Bank (PDB)</a>. Specify one or more organisms whose genes to retrieve; one or more clades of organisms whose PDB records should be considered; and a p-value exponent cutoff.

The mapping from <i>Plasmodium</i> genes is through BLAST of the protein product to the sequence associated by PDB to their structure chains.  

!Centromere Proximity (P.f. only)
Find <i>P. falciparum</i> genes within a given distance from an annotated centromere location.

!Exported Protein
Find genes that are predicted by ExportPred to produce an exported protein.

!Presence in Genbank, RefSeq or Swissprot
Find genes whose predicted protein product has an amino-acid sequence identical to that of a record from GenBank, RefSeq or Swiss-Prot.

!Y2H Protein Interaction (P.f. only)
Find genes that interact with a given gene, as determined by yeast two-hybrid experiments.  <br><br>
        <i>Times reproduced</i> refers to the number of independent yeast two-hybrid screens in which a given interaction was found. Interactions found in two or more yeast two-hybrid screens were independently reproduced, and are thus more likely to be true yeast two-hybrid positives. 
<br><br>
<i>Times observed</i> refers to the total number of times a given interaction was identified in all yeast two-hybrid screens.  An  interaction can be identified multiple times in the same screen for several reasons: (1) The original yeast cell containing the pair of  interacting proteins divided before being plated on selective media; (2) The same prey plasmid was present in the library multiple times  and thus gave rise to multiple positive colonies; or (3) The prey  gene was present in the library as multiple independent, overlapping  fragments, all of which interact with a given bait.  Only (3) provides independent confirmation of a putative interaction.
<br><br>
Protein interactions were experimentally determined using the yeast two-hybrid system as described in LaCount DJ, Vignali M, Chettier R, Phansalkar A, Bell R, Hesselberth JR, Schoenfeld LW, Ota I, Sahasrabudhe S, Kurschner C, Fields S, Hughes RE.  A protein interaction network of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Nature. 2005 438:103-7.

!Predicted Functional Interaction (P.f. only)
Find genes of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (strain HB3) identified by the <a href="http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/plasmoMAP">plasmoMAP</a> project to have a functional interaction with the given gene. 

<br><br>Input a gene ID and a minimum interaction likelihood score.  Scores range from 2 to 9435, and increasing scores indicate higher confidence.  Generally, a likelihood score of 10 or more indicates a high-confidence interaction.

<br><br>There are 388,969 total predicted protein pairs in the result set, with likelihood scores ranging from 2 to 9435. Below a score of 2, the number of false positives exceed the number of true positives. Most protein-protein interaction pairs (~79%) have a likelihood score of below 10, while about 20% of the pairs have a likelihood score between 10 and 9435 (only 251 pairs, or about 0.06% of the total, have a likelihood score above 100).

<br><br>Emperical observations of the results show that while many pairs with very low likelihood scores (say between 2-4) are biologically valid, the predicted interactions are likely to be highly accurate as the scores approach a value of 10. In the published manuscript, a score of 14 was used to isolate a high-confidence subset of interactions, where the number of true positives was about 10 times greater than the number of false positives.

!Protein Secondary Structure
              Find genes whose proteins are predicted to have the given secondary-structure content by the PSIPRED program. The percent composition is computed by counting the amino acids in which one of the three calls is given the highest confidence, and dividing by the length of the protein.  For example the percent helix is the number of amino acids in which helix has the highest confidence, divided by the length of the protein.

!Predicted 3D Structure (P.f. only)
             Find <i>P. falciparum</i> genes that have 
              computationally predicted 3D structure models.  
              <br><br>
              The models were generated

              structures of similar proteins (from <a href="http://www.rcsb.org">PDB</a>).
 
!Homolog Phylogenetic Profile (P.f. only)
Find <i>P. falciparum</i> genes that have a homology-based phylogenetic profile similar to a specified gene.
          <br><br>

The phylogenetic profile (homology-based) of a <i>P. falicparum</i> gene is a series of 164 "present" or "absent" calls reflecting the presence or absence of a putative homolog in 164 completely sequenced genomes. Similarity between profiles is a good indicator of functional linkages between proteins (see Pellegrini M, Marcotte EM, Thompson MJ, Eisenberg D, Yeates TO. Assigning protein functions by comparative genome analysis: protein phylogenetic profiles. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999 96, 4285-4288). Data on ORFs with the most similar profiles to a given query ORF is also available, and can be used to establish the function of uncharacterized ORFs, based on the similarity of their profiles (see Date SV & Marcotte EM. Discovery of uncharacterized cellular systems by genome-wide analysis of functional linkages. Nature Biotechnology 2003 21:1055-1062) with ORFs of known function.

!Orthologs and Paralogs
Find genes that have been identified by the <a href="http://orthomcl.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/OrthoMclWeb.cgi">OrthoMCL</a> project as orthologous (or paralagous) to a given gene.

!Expression Timing (P.f only)
              Find genes with peaks or troughs occuring within specified intervals during the intraerythrocytic infection cycle.  Five intraerythrocytic time courses may be
              queried in turn (and results may be combined using the
              <a href="showQueryHistory.do">query history</a>).  The five time
              courses are those provided by the
              <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/cb/winzeler/index.html">Winzeler
              Lab</a> and the <a href="http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/">DeRisi
              Lab</a> -- the first two time courses rely on photolithographic
              (Affy) arrays and employ sorbitol and temperature
              synchronizations, while the other three time courses rely on a
              glass slide array and analyze HB3, 3D7, and Dd2 parasites.

!Expression Percentile (P.f. only)
        Find genes expressed in 
        early ring, late ring, early trophozoite, late trophozoite, early
        schizont, late schizont, merozoite, sporozoite, or gametocyte.  
        <br><br>
        
        The data is from a total of 17 microarray experiments (1) performed using an
        Affymetrix short oligonucleotide platform.  Cultures were synchronized
        using two independent methods, 5% D-sorbitol and temperature cycling,
        for all developmental stages except Gametocyte and Sporozoite.  This
        platform contains oligos (25-mers) derived from the predicted coding
        regions of the entire <I>P. falciparum</I> genome.
        <P>Expression values for each probe set were obtained by the MOID
        algorithm (2). Queries can be performed to retrieve only those genes
        in at least the Xth percentile level, where X can be from 95 to 5.  In
        this way it is possible to select only the most highly expressed
        genes, to any desired level above the 5th percentile.  Genes are
        returned in decreasing order of their intensity.
        <p>However, please note that, regardless of the percentile expression
        level selected, only genes that are above background and whose
        observed expression level would not be expected by chance (MOID
        expression level >10 and logP < -0.5) are included and will be
        reported.  This means that genes that have only a single probe on the
        array will not be reported as their logP values will always be too
        high to satisfy the query.

!Protein Expression (P.f only)
                Find <I>P. falciparum</I> genes that have evidence of
                expression in a specific lifecycle stage
                or within a subcellular fraction of the parasite. Select the experimental condition which have MS/MS peptide
                evidence and only genes with proteomics evidence will be
                returned,  i.e. genes whose proteins have  minimum number of 1
                observed MS spectrum or identified peptides. Specify a
                higher number for these values to select proteins
                that will be more abundant in the examined experimental
                condition/developmental stage/subcellular fraction. These values are not strictly quantitative
                as the detection of proteins in MS/MS analyses is dependent on
                solubility of the proteins and other factors. Specify the amount of amino acid sequence (sequence
                coverage) in % that was identified in the respective assay.
